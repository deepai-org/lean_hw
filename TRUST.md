# Trust and claim audit

This document is the adversarial reading guide for Loom's claims. The
authoritative release theorem and trusted list are in [`TCB.md`](TCB.md); the
commands are in [`REPRODUCING.md`](REPRODUCING.md); the current gate state is
in [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md). This page avoids duplicating those inventories.

## Property adequacy

### Timing and observation

LNP64-µ T5 is architectural noninterference over a projected observation
(`regs`, `pc`, `run`, and `cause`) after destuttering. It deliberately erases
when events occur. It is therefore not a timing-channel or power-channel
theorem.

T5 is conditional. The compared manifests and domain must satisfy the exact
`Isolated`, `TopPriority`, `AgreeOn`, code-locality, slot, and W^X-disjointness
premises in `Machines/Lnp64u/Theorems/T5.lean`. The repository includes
concrete premise witnesses, but no summary should shorten the result to
“LNP64-µ provides isolation” without those conditions.

### Progress

T6 and T7 are closed-machine scheduling theorems under explicit strict or
non-strict schedulability and budget hypotheses. They do not establish useful
instruction retirement under arbitrary external memory backpressure,
interrupt storms, clock gating, repeated reset, debug intervention, or
unmodeled exception loops.

The proofs account for modeled issue, countdown, retirement, refill, gate,
and Mover events. A platform must separately say how interrupts, cache/TLB
misses, bus stalls, flushes, and context-switch overhead are charged. Otherwise
the platform can introduce denial of service without contradicting T5 safety.

### Reset and two-state logic

The formal machine starts from `Manifest.initState` or the compiled module's
modeled reset state. This assumes that every proof-visible state element has
the intended value. Electrical reset networks, clock/PLL sequencing, scan,
retention, and partially reset peripherals are not proved.

Lean and the µVerilog semantics use two-state bit vectors. The release RTL
hygiene script rejects major X/Z constructs and incomplete reset/images, but
is a text-level defense, not a complete theorem about Verilog's four-state
semantics or every synthesis don't-care optimization.

### Closed-machine scope

The security proofs cover state changes represented in the model. External
DMA, interrupts, debug, buses, MMU/IOMMU policy, coherency, and peripherals
cannot be assumed safe merely because they connect to a verified core. They
must be excluded by integration policy or modeled through ports with explicit
contracts.

Fault behavior has the same rule. The model gives deterministic outcomes to
modeled illegal instructions and authority failures. An SoC claim must account
for every additional fault, trap, interrupt, and debug source.

## Proof and artifact chain

| Link | What is established | Remaining boundary |
|---|---|---|
| LNP64-µ model and T1–T9 | Kernel-checked declarations with explicit hypotheses | Adequacy of definitions and external review |
| ISS to EDSL core | Unbounded simulation from reset for the modeled machine | Platform behavior absent from both sides |
| EDSL to µVerilog module semantics | Generic compiler-correctness theorems | Concrete text interpretation |
| Concrete SSA witness | Complete declarative denotation as the reference compilation | Generator may fail, but acceptance is kernel-checked |
| Renderer to theorem bytes | Kernel equality over bounded rope leaves | Host file must be associated externally |
| Theorem bytes to RTL files | Exact external `cmp` binder | Correctness of the small binder and host execution |
| RTL text to Verilog behavior | Explicit concrete-SSA adequacy assumption | Verilog tool semantics and four-state effects |
| RTL to synthesized netlist | Optional fragment-reporting equivalence checks with LRAT recheck | Driver, executable encoder replacement, netlist/cell model, exclusions, unsupported operators, acknowledgements |
| Netlist to bitstream/silicon | Dated simulation and hardware corroboration | P&R, configuration, timing, reset, CDC physics, analog and side channels |

The release theorem stops before the text-tool row. Passing lower rows does
not enlarge the theorem above them.

## Lean-side controls and residual risk

`lake exe audit` walks compiled declarations and enforces:

- only the three standard axioms, plus two named project declarations that
  expose the legacy µVerilog boundary, in permitted theorem closures;
- no disallowed `sorry` outside theorem/WIP policy;
- no `native_decide` or trusted-compiler theorem dependency;
- no imports from `Machines` or `Tools` into `Loom`; and
- an exact whitelist for unsafe declarations and `implemented_by`, with no
  source `partial` or `extern`.

The audit is useful defense in depth, not a kernel axiom. A bug in its report
cannot cause Lean to accept a bad proof, but could hide policy drift. The final
release declaration and raw axiom closure remain independently inspectable.

Executable replacements currently accelerate compiler/printer traversals,
`Design.toProgram`, memory-read diagnostics, and the equivalence checker's
bit-blaster. The release construction checks candidate witnesses against
reference definitions, so those replacements are not premises of
`verifiedReleases`. The equivalence checker is different: trusting a netlist
report also requires trusting that the executed replacement and driver match
the proved reference encoder.

Mathlib adds proof code but not a second proof kernel: its declarations are
checked by Lean. CaDiCaL and other solvers are untrusted proposal engines where
their UNSAT answers are accompanied by LRAT certificates checked by the proved
checker.

The separate `checker/` project is an independent **LRAT** implementation for
cross-validation. It is not an independent Lean kernel or export checker and
has no soundness theorem of its own.

## Synthesis, memories, and CDC

The post-synthesis checker materially improves evidence but is deliberately
not summarized as “synthesis is proved.” It reports its operator fragment,
matched/excluded signals, memory-bank coverage, and acknowledged defects.
Large SoC checks belong to the manual/nightly workflow; ordinary CI runs only
small designs when Yosys and CaDiCaL are present.

Memory target profiles and `syncReadOkB` are prevention/diagnostic mechanisms.
They predict whether a design shape fits a declared technology; actual mapping
and reset-image delivery still need downstream checking. SRAM initialization
is especially target-sensitive.

Board CDC proofs model the first synchronizer sample adversarially and prove
the digital toggle protocol for all Boolean resolutions. They do not prove a
flop resolves before the next edge, its MTBF, placement constraints, or any
analog fact. Those are explicit physical assumptions.

## Current hardware evidence

The current LNP64mini integration head has restored zero-trap execution on
silicon but still fails to bring up the network; core 0 halts and core 1
remains in a futex wait. Consequently there is no accepted NetBSD, Ethernet,
SMP, epoch, or capability board claim for this head. See [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md)
and `Machines/Lnp64mini/EXTEND_SPEC.md`.

## Review priorities

The most valuable independent review is:

1. statement review of `Wf`, `Acyclic`, T5's observation and premises, and
   T6/T7 scheduling assumptions;
2. clean-clone Tier A reproduction without accepting cached objects;
3. adversarial review of the tiny host-file binder and concrete-SSA boundary;
4. independent parsing/cell-library review of netlist equivalence reports;
5. explicit SoC contracts for reset, DMA, interrupts, debug, memory stalls,
   and fault routing; and
6. a complete board acceptance run on the release commit.

The right publication wording is: the kernel proves the stated model and
artifact relations; exact host bytes are bound by one disclosed comparison;
tool, integration, and physical claims remain conditional and separately
corroborated.
